## Process

### Pre-Writing Review
- **Research Brief**: Review research brief from `/research` command if available
- **Brand Voice**: Check @context/brand-voice.md for tone and messaging
- **Writing Examples**: Study @context/writing-examples.md for style consistency
- **Style Guide**: Follow formatting rules from @context/style-guide.md
- **SEO Guidelines**: Apply requirements from @context/seo-guidelines.md
- **Target Keywords**: Integrate keywords from @context/target-keywords.md naturally

### Content Structure

#### 1. Headline (H1)
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Create compelling, click-worthy title
- Keep under 60 characters for SERP display
- Promise clear value to reader

#### 2. Introduction (150-250 words)

**CRITICAL: Direct Answer First (AI Search Optimization)**

For any "best/top/how" query, the first 1-2 sentences MUST directly answer the question. AI scrapers (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) pull from the top of the page. Don't bury the answer behind narrative.

**Example — "best project management tools":**
> The best project management tools in 2026 are Asana, Monday, and ClickUp — each built for different team sizes and workflows. Here's how they compare.

After the direct answer, use a hook to keep human readers engaged.

**Choose ONE hook type for each article:**

| Hook Type | Example | Best For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Provocative Question** | "What if the 'free' plan is actually costing you $500/month in lost opportunities?" | Challenging assumptions |
| **Specific Scenario** | "Last Tuesday, Sarah checked her dashboard and discovered something alarming: her site had been invisible to Google for three weeks." | Creating emotional connection |
| **Surprising Statistic** | "73% of SaaS users who switch platforms do so within 18 months, and most cite the same three reasons." | Data-driven topics |
| **Bold Statement** | "Your current tool is lying to you about your numbers." | Controversial takes |
| **Counterintuitive Claim** | "The cheapest option might be the most expensive decision you make this year." | Comparison content |

**After the hook, follow the APP Formula:**
- **Agree**: Acknowledge something the reader already believes/feels
- **Promise**: Tell them exactly what they'll learn or gain
- **Preview**: Brief overview of what's coming (can include mini table of contents for long posts)

- **Keyword**: Include primary keyword in first 100 words
- **Credibility**: Establish why you/this article is authoritative

#### 3. Key Takeaways Block (After Introduction)

**REQUIRED: TL;DR block immediately after the introduction, before the first H2 body section.**

This gets pulled into AI-generated summaries and helps both AI and human readers quickly assess the article's value.

```markdown
> **Key Takeaways**
> - [Core finding or recommendation #1]
> - [Core finding or recommendation #2]
> - [Core finding or recommendation #3]
> - [Core finding or recommendation #4 if needed]
> - [Core finding or recommendation #5 if needed]
```

**Rules:**
- 3-5 bullet points
- Each bullet is a standalone claim with specifics (numbers, names, outcomes)
- NOT a table of contents — these are the article's actual conclusions
- Written after the full article is drafted (so the takeaways are accurate)

#### 4. Main Body (1800-2500+ words)
- **Logical Flow**: Organize sections in clear, progressive order
- **H2 Sections**: 4-7 main sections covering comprehensive topic scope
- **H3 Subsections**: Break complex sections into digestible pieces
- **Keyword Integration**: Use primary keyword 1-2% density, variations throughout
- **Depth**: Provide thorough, actionable information at each point
- **Data**: Reference statistics and studies to support claims
- **Visuals**: Note where images, screenshots, or graphics enhance understanding
- **YouTube Embed**: Include at least one relevant YouTube video (prefer your own channel, then authoritative third-party) — AI models cross-reference video and article content
- **Lists**: Use bulleted or numbered lists for scannability
- **Formatting**: Bold key concepts, use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences MAX)

**REQUIRED: Mini-Stories (2-3 per article)**

Research shows we're 22x more likely to remember facts wrapped in stories. Every article MUST include 2-3 mini-scenarios with:
- A **specific person** (use names, even if fictional: "Sarah," "Mike," "The team at Acme Corp")
- A **concrete situation** with details (dates, numbers, specifics)
- A **clear outcome** that illustrates the point

**Example mini-story (aim for 50-150 words each):**
> "When Marcus launched his SaaS product in March 2024, he chose the cheapest hosting plan he could find, $5/month seemed like a no-brainer. Six months later, his app hit 10,000 active users. That's when he discovered the hidden bandwidth fees buried in his provider's terms. His $5/month plan suddenly became $89/month. Worse, migrating mid-growth meant a 3-week gap in analytics that cost him a $2,000 partnership deal. The 'savings' from cheap hosting cost him over $3,000."

**Place mini-stories:**
- One in the introduction or early section (to hook readers)
- One in the middle (to re-engage skimmers)
- One near the conclusion (to reinforce the main point)

**REQUIRED: Contextual CTAs (2-3 per article)**

Don't just put one CTA at the end. Embedded CTAs get 121% more conversions than end-only CTAs.

**CTA Placement Strategy:**
| Location | CTA Type | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| After first major value section | Soft CTA (learn more) | "Want to see how this works in practice? [Explore our features →]" |
| After comparison/proof section | Medium CTA (try it) | "**Ready to test the difference?** Start a free trial, no credit card required." |
| End of article | Strong CTA (convert) | "**[Start Your Free Trial →]**" with supporting text |

**CTA Rules:**
- Make CTAs contextual (relate to the section content)
- Vary the format (inline text, bold callout, button-style)
- First CTA should appear within the first 500 words
- Never use generic "Click here" text

#### 5. Conclusion (150-200 words)
- **Recap**: Summarize 3-5 key takeaways
- **Action**: Provide clear next steps for reader
- **CTA**: Include relevant call-to-action (free trial, resource download, etc.)
- **Encouragement**: End on empowering, forward-looking note

## File Management
After completing the article, automatically save to:
- **File Location**: `drafts/[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- **File Format**: Markdown with frontmatter and formatted content
- **Naming Convention**: Use lowercase, hyphenated topic slug and current date

Example: `drafts/content-marketing-strategies-2025-10-15.md`

## Automatic Content Scrubbing

**CRITICAL**: Immediately after saving the article file, automatically invoke the content scrubber to remove AI watermarks and telltale patterns.

### Why This Matters
AI-generated content often contains invisible Unicode watermarks and characteristic patterns (like em-dash overuse) that can identify it as AI-written. Scrubbing removes these indicators to make content appear naturally human-written.

### Scrubbing Process
1. **Invoke Scrubber**: Run `/scrub [file-path]` on the saved article file
2. **Automatic Execution**: This should happen automatically, not require user action
3. **Timing**: Must occur immediately after file save, before any other processing
4. **Scope**: Scrub the main article file only (not meta or analysis files)

### What Gets Cleaned
- Invisible Unicode watermarks (zero-width spaces, BOMs, format-control characters)
- Em-dashes replaced with contextually appropriate punctuation (commas, semicolons, periods)
- Whitespace normalization and formatting cleanup
- All changes preserve content meaning and markdown structure

### Verification
The scrubber will display statistics:
- Unicode watermarks removed
- Format-control characters removed
- Em-dashes replaced

### Example Workflow
```
1. Write article → Save to drafts/article-name-2025-10-31.md
2. IMMEDIATELY run: /scrub drafts/article-name-2025-10-31.md
3. Verify scrubbing statistics
4. THEN proceed with optimization agents below
```

This ensures all published content is free of AI signatures before any further processing.

## Automatic Agent Execution
After saving the main article, immediately execute optimization agents:

### 1. Content Analyzer Agent (NEW!)
- **Agent**: `content-analyzer`
- **Input**: Full article, meta elements, keywords, SERP data (if available)
- **Output**: Comprehensive analysis covering search intent, keyword density, content length comparison, readability score, and SEO quality rating
- **File**: `drafts/content-analysis-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

This new agent uses 5 specialized analysis modules:
- Search intent analysis
- Keyword density & clustering
- Content length vs competitors
- Readability scoring (Flesch scores)
- SEO quality rating (0-100)

### 2. SEO Optimizer Agent
- **Agent**: `seo-optimizer`
- **Input**: Full article content
- **Output**: SEO optimization report and suggestions
- **File**: `drafts/seo-report-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

### 3. Meta Creator Agent
- **Agent**: `meta-creator`
- **Input**: Article content and primary keyword
- **Output**: Multiple meta title/description options
- **File**: `drafts/meta-options-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

### 4. Internal Linker Agent
- **Agent**: `internal-linker`
- **Input**: Article content
- **Output**: Specific internal linking recommendations
- **File**: `drafts/link-suggestions-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

### 5. Keyword Mapper Agent
- **Agent**: `keyword-mapper`
- **Input**: Article and target keywords
- **Output**: Keyword placement analysis and improvements
- **File**: `drafts/keyword-analysis-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## Automatic Quality Loop

After saving the initial draft, automatically run the content quality scorer:

### Step 1: Score Content
Run the content scorer to evaluate the draft:
```bash
python data_sources/modules/content_scorer.py drafts/[article-file].md
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Score
The scorer evaluates 5 dimensions (composite score must be ≥70):

| Dimension | Weight | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Humanity/Voice | 30% | No AI phrases, use contractions |
| Specificity | 25% | Concrete examples, numbers, names |
| Structure Balance | 20% | 40-70% prose (not all lists) |
| SEO Compliance | 15% | Keywords, meta, structure |
| Readability | 10% | Flesch 60-70, grade 8-10 |

### Step 3: Auto-Revise if Needed
If composite score < 70:
1. Review the `priority_fixes` from the scorer
2. Apply the top 3-5 fixes automatically
3. Re-score the content
4. Repeat once more if still below threshold

### Step 4: Route Based on Final Score
- **Score ≥ 70**: Save to `drafts/` and proceed to optimization agents
- **Score < 70 after 2 iterations**: Save to `review-required/` with a `_REVIEW_NOTES.md` file containing the scoring details and remaining issues

### Review-Required Folder
Articles that fail quality threshold after 2 revision attempts go to `review-required/`:
```
review-required/
├── article-name-2025-12-10.md
└── article-name-2025-12-10_REVIEW_NOTES.md
```

The `_REVIEW_NOTES.md` file contains:
- Final composite score
- Dimension breakdown
- Remaining priority fixes
- Reason for human review

## Quality Standards
Every article must meet these requirements:

### Content Requirements
- Minimum 2000 words (2500-3000+ preferred)
- Proper H1/H2/H3 hierarchy
- Primary keyword naturally integrated
- 3-5 internal links to your site content
- 2-3 external authoritative links
- Compelling meta title and description
- Clear introduction and conclusion
- Actionable, valuable information
- Brand voice maintained
- Target audience focused

### Engagement Requirements
- **Compelling hook** in first 1-2 sentences (no generic openings)

- **2-3 contextual CTAs** distributed throughout (not just at end)
- **First CTA within 500 words**
- **No paragraphs longer than 4 sentences**
- **Varied sentence rhythm** (mix short punchy + longer flowing)

### Quality Score
- **Composite quality score ≥70**
- Publish-ready quality

This ensures every article is comprehensive, optimized, engaging, and ready to rank while providing genuine value to your target audience.
