# Article Command

A unified content creation pipeline that produces comprehensive, SEO-optimized articles through mandatory research, strategic planning, and section-by-section writing.

## Usage
`/article [topic]`

**Examples:**
- `/article "Best Project Management Tools for Small Teams"`
- `/article "Content Marketing Strategy Guide 2025"`
- `/article "How to Migrate from Competitor to Your Product"`

## What This Command Does

Creates high-quality articles by enforcing a 4-step pipeline where **research is mandatory, not optional**:

```
STEP 1: SERP Analysis           → See what Google rewards TODAY
STEP 2: Social Research         → Mine Reddit + YouTube for real insights
STEP 3: Article Planning        → Section-by-section strategy
STEP 4: Section Writing         → Write/edit each section individually
```

This prevents the "AI knows everything" trap that produces generic content matching competitors instead of beating them.

## When to Use This vs /write

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Comprehensive new article | `/article` |
| Competitive topics | `/article` |
| Topics where you need to beat existing content | `/article` |
| Quick drafts from existing research | `/write` |
| Simple updates to existing content | `/write` |

---

## STEP 1: SERP Analysis (MANDATORY)

**You MUST research before writing. No exceptions.**

### Process

1. **Search the Target Keyword**
   Use WebSearch to find what's currently ranking:
   ```
   WebSearch: "[topic] industry" OR "[topic] industrying"
   ```

2. **Analyze Top 5 Ranking Articles**
   For each top-ranking article, use WebFetch and document:

   | Element | What to Capture |
   |---------|-----------------|
   | **Structure** | H2 headings, section order, content type |
   | **Word Count** | Approximate length |
   | **Gaps** | Topics covered superficially (<150 words) |
   | **Missing Angles** | Perspectives not addressed |
   | **Unsupported Claims** | Statements without data/sources |
   | **Outdated Info** | Old statistics, deprecated tools |
   | **What They Do Well** | Strong sections to match |

3. **Build Competitor Gap Blueprint**
   Document opportunities where your brand content can beat, not match:
   - Gaps found in all competitors (must-fill)
   - Unique angles no one covers
   - Data needed to be more specific
   - Outdated info to update with 2025 data

### Output
Save to: `research/serp-analysis-[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

```markdown
# SERP Analysis: [Topic]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## STEP 2: Social Research (MANDATORY)

**The best insights aren't in SEO content - they're in Reddit threads and YouTube tutorials.**

### Reddit Research (Visit 5 Actual Threads)

1. **Search Reddit**
   ```
   WebSearch: site:reddit.com [topic] industry
   WebSearch: site:reddit.com r/industrying [topic]
   ```

2. **Visit 5 Promising Threads**
   Use WebFetch on each thread URL. Extract:

   | Element | What to Look For |
   |---------|------------------|
   | **OP's Question** | The specific problem/question |
   | **Top Comments** | Upvoted solutions and advice |
   | **Pain Points** | Frustrations users express |
   | **Success Stories** | Real outcomes with details |
   | **Debates** | Different perspectives |
   | **Recommendations** | What the community endorses |
   | **Real Language** | How actual users talk about this |

3. **Extract Quotable Insights**
   Pull specific quotes that can inform (or be used in) the article.

### YouTube Research (Analyze 5 Videos)

1. **Search YouTube**
   ```
   WebSearch: site:youtube.com [topic] industry tutorial
   WebSearch: site:youtube.com [topic] industry review
   ```

2. **Analyze 5 Video Pages**
   Use WebFetch on each video page. Extract:

   | Element | What to Look For |
   |---------|------------------|
   | **Title & Description** | What they cover |
   | **View Count** | Engagement signal |
   | **Topics Covered** | Main points discussed |
   | **Gaps** | What they don't cover well |
   | **Comments** | What viewers ask about |

## STEP 4: Section-by-Section Writing

**Write each section individually to maintain quality.**

### Why Section-by-Section?
- Long-form AI writing degrades in quality toward the end
- Each section gets focused attention
- Each section gets its own editing pass
- Maintains consistent quality throughout

### Section Types & Specialized Approaches

#### Introduction
**Requirements:**
- **Direct answer first** (AI Search Optimization): For any "best/top/how" query, the first 1-2 sentences MUST directly answer the question before the narrative hook. AI scrapers pull from the top of the page.
- Hook (NOT generic opening - use question/scenario/stat/bold statement)
- APP Formula: Agree, Promise, Preview
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Trust signal
- 150-250 words

**Do NOT open with:**
- "[Product category] is..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "If you're looking for..."
- "In today's world..."

#### Key Takeaways Block (After Introduction, Before First H2)
**Requirements:**
- 3-5 bullet points summarizing the article's actual conclusions
- Each bullet is a standalone claim with specifics (numbers, names, outcomes)
- NOT a table of contents — these are the conclusions up front
- Format as blockquote with bold "Key Takeaways" header
- Written after full article is drafted, then placed here

#### Body: How-To
**Requirements:**
- Numbered steps for sequential processes
- Each step actionable and specific
- Time estimates where helpful
- Common mistakes to avoid
- 250-400 words per section

#### Body: Comparison
**Requirements:**
- Balanced (acknowledge competitor strengths)
- Data tables for key metrics
- Specific prices/features
- "Best for" recommendations
- 300-400 words per section

#### Body: Explanation
**Requirements:**
- Progressive complexity (simple → advanced)
- Analogies for complex concepts
- Examples with specifics
- Embed at least one relevant YouTube video in a body section where it adds context (prefer your own channel, then authoritative third-party)
- 250-400 words per section

#### FAQ
**Requirements:**
- 4-6 questions from research (real user questions)
- 40-60 word answers (featured snippet optimized)
- Direct answer first, then context
- 200-300 words total

#### Conclusion
**Requirements:**
- NOT just a summary - add value
- 3-5 key takeaways as actionable items
- Clear next steps ("This week:", "This month:")
- Strong CTA with risk reversal
- Empowering, forward-looking close
- 150-250 words

### Writing Process Per Section

For each section in the plan:

1. **Write Draft**
   - Use section-specific requirements above
   - Include planned unique data/insights from research
   - Follow word target
   - Apply planned engagement hook

2. **Edit Pass**
   - Remove AI phrases ("In today's", "It's important to note", "When it comes to")
   - Replace vague words with specifics ("many" → "73%")
   - Check paragraph length (max 4 sentences)
   - Vary sentence rhythm (mix 5-10 word + 15-25 word)
   - Add conversational devices (contractions, questions, parenthetical asides)
   - Verify active voice

3. **Verify Requirements**
   - Section-specific criteria met
   - Planned insights included
   - Word target within ±10%

### Assembly

After all sections are written and edited:

1. **Combine Sections**
   - Assemble in planned order
   - Check transitions between sections
   - Verify internal link placement
   - Confirm CTA distribution

2. **Add Meta Elements**
   ```markdown
   ---
   Meta Title: [50-60 chars]
   Meta Description: [150-160 chars]
   Primary Keyword: [keyword]
   Secondary Keywords: [list]
   URL Slug: /blog/[slug]

### Output
Save to: `drafts/[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

---

## Post-Writing Quality Loop

After saving the draft:

### 1. Scrub AI Patterns
```
/scrub drafts/[filename].md
```
Removes invisible Unicode watermarks and AI telltale patterns.

### 2. Score Content Quality
```bash
python data_sources/modules/content_scorer.py drafts/[filename].md
```

**Score Threshold: 70+**

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Humanity/Voice | 30% |
| Specificity | 25% |
| Structure Balance | 20% |
| SEO Compliance | 15% |
| Readability | 10% |

### 3. Auto-Revise if Needed
If score < 70:
1. Review `priority_fixes` from scorer
2. Apply top 3-5 fixes
3. Re-score
4. Repeat once more if needed
5. If still < 70 after 2 iterations → move to `review-required/`

### 4. Run Optimization Agents
After passing quality threshold:
- `content-analyzer` agent
- `seo-optimizer` agent
- `meta-creator` agent
- `internal-linker` agent
- `keyword-mapper` agent
