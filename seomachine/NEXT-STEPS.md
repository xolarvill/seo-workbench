## Before You Start Writing

### 1. Configure Context Files (CRITICAL!)

The AI learns your voice and requirements from these files. Fill them in:

**High Priority** (Required for good results):
1. **`context/brand-voice.md`**
   - Add your company-specific voice characteristics
   - Include messaging pillars
   - Define tone variations
   - Add do's and don'ts

2. **`context/writing-examples.md`**
   - Add 3-5 complete your company blog posts
   - Include best-performing articles
   - Note what makes each example great
   - This is HOW the AI learns your style

3. **`context/internal-links-map.md`**
   - List all key your company pages (product, features, blog)
   - Organize by topic cluster
   - Include URLs and when to link to each
   - Critical for internal linking strategy

**Medium Priority** (Fill in as you go):
4. **`context/target-keywords.md`**
   - Add your keyword research
   - Organize by topic cluster
   - List pillar and cluster keywords
   - Update as you do keyword research

5. **`context/style-guide.md`**
   - Make decisions on capitalization, punctuation
   - Add your company-specific terminology
   - Define formatting preferences

6. **`context/competitor-analysis.md`**
   - Add your main competitors
   - Document their content strategies
   - Identify gaps and opportunities

**Already Complete** (Review and adjust):
7. **`context/seo-guidelines.md`** - Already filled with best practices

### 2. Test the System

Try a simple workflow to ensure everything works:

```bash
# 1. Open the project in Claude Code
claude-code .

# 2. Try researching a topic
/research a topic relevant to your business

# 3. Review the research brief that gets created in /research

# 4. Write an article based on the research
/write a topic relevant to your business

# 5. Check the drafts folder for your article and agent reports
```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository

To push this to GitHub:

**Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create repository named "your company-writer"
3. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)
4. Copy the repository URL
5. Run these commands:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/your company-writer.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Option 2: Using GitHub CLI** (if you have it)
```bash
gh repo create your company-writer --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

**Option 3: Keep it Private**
```bash
gh repo create your company-writer --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Recommended Workflow for First Article

### Day 1: Setup
1. ✅ Fill in `context/brand-voice.md` with your company voice
2. ✅ Add 3-5 examples to `context/writing-examples.md`
3. ✅ Map key pages in `context/internal-links-map.md`

### Day 2: First Article
1. Add topic idea to `topics/` folder
2. Run `/research [topic]`
3. Review research brief
4. Run `/write [topic]`
5. Review article and agent reports
6. Make recommended improvements
7. Run `/optimize [article]`
8. Final review and publish

### Day 3+: Optimize Workflow
1. Update existing content with `/analyze-existing`
2. Batch research multiple topics
3. Create content calendar in `topics/`
4. Build out topic clusters systematically

## Tips for Success

### Getting Great Results
- **Example quality = Output quality**: The better your examples in `writing-examples.md`, the better the AI writes
- **Be specific in context files**: Vague guidelines = generic output
- **Review and iterate**: First drafts are starting points, not final products
- **Use the agents**: They catch things you might miss

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Skipping context file configuration
- ❌ Not providing writing examples
- ❌ Ignoring agent recommendations
- ❌ Publishing without optimization
- ❌ Forgetting to update internal-links-map

### Workflow Efficiency
- Research multiple topics in one session
- Use consistent article structure
- Address high-priority fixes first
- Let agents handle analysis
- Build reusable templates

## Support & Resources

### Documentation
- **README.md** - Complete workflow guide
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How to improve the system
- Each command and agent file has detailed instructions

### Troubleshooting
- Review the "Troubleshooting" section in README.md
- Check that context files are properly filled in
- Ensure Claude Code is up to date

### Updates
- Star the GitHub repo for updates
- Check for new commands/agents periodically
- Share improvements back to the project

## Quick Reference

### Most Common Commands
```bash
/research [topic]          # Research before writing
/write [topic]             # Create new article
/analyze-existing [URL]    # Audit existing post
/rewrite [topic]           # Update existing content
/optimize [file]           # Final polish
```

### File Locations
- Topic ideas: `topics/`
- Research briefs: `research/`
- Drafts: `drafts/`
- Rewrites: `rewrites/`
- Published: `published/`

### Context Reference Priority
1. `brand-voice.md` - Voice and tone
2. `writing-examples.md` - Style examples
3. `seo-guidelines.md` - SEO requirements
4. `internal-links-map.md` - Pages to link to
5. `target-keywords.md` - Keywords to target

## Ready to Start!

Your system is complete. The next steps:

1. **Configure context files** (especially brand-voice and writing-examples)
2. **Test with one article** to verify everything works
3. **Push to GitHub** if you want version control
4. **Start creating** amazing SEO content for your company!
